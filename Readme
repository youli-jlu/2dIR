spectra calculation program written in c++ and python/cython.
simply "pip install spectra2d-..." to install package into your python environment.
Note: This program need fftw environment. Make sure you have already installed dynamic fftw package .
basic operation can be referred to "test.py"

kwargs for basic parameter:
1.spectra method:
dimension: int(1) for linear spectra and int(2) for 2d spectra
response: specify response function calculation  "condon","non-condon","cummulant"
          if "cummulant", calculate  frequency correlation function, too.
Note: cummulant method was suggested for calculation efficiency and spectra smoothness.
Note: the b synbol before string transfer string type to bytes.
2.I/O file:
freqfile: specify frequency file.
tdfile: specify transition
spectrafile: specify output spectra file.
3.parameter for 1d spectra:
dt:time interval of frequency and transition dipole. defualt unit:fs
readgap: read gap of freq and td.
dt_time_average: time interval in time average calculation.
Note: to use ensemble average with multiple trajectory , simply add them end to first, 
      and set dt_time_average to total time of each trajectory (total time should be the same).
zeropodding: specify how many zero-padding time. 
      You can get better frequency resolution by increasing it. 
maxfreq/minfreq: max or min value of output spectra.
trans1relaxation: relaxation time of transition1. defualt unit:ps
4.parameter for 2d spectra:
all parameter in 1d, and:
t2: waiting time in 2d spectra.
trans2relaxation: relaxation time of transition2.



Input format:
frequencies and transition dipole(polarizability) are main material. 
Standard format can be referred to "freq-hod.dat" and "td.dat".
Other parameter especially response time should chosen specifically.
Tips: you can plot response function. Let response time longer than convergence boundary.

Output:
1.response function:
For linear spectra, response function will be saved in "1dresponse" file.
For 2d spectra, rephasing and non-resphasing response will be saved in "rephasing" and "non-rephasing" file.
2.spectra:
Only real part of Fourier transformation will be saved.
If 2d spectra, save  rephasing and non-rephasing separately.



FOR DEVELOPER:
To add other attribute or class in python , you can modify spectra2d.pyx 
To call other c++ module, you can change  IR2d.pxd and also spectra2d.pyx
simply "./2whl.sh", you can build your python package.
then "pip install /dist/spectra..." to install it.

If you are satisfied to pure c++ , 
Makefile1d/2d can build 1d and 2d version separately.
